description: When the Ibbotson sisters, Hester and Margaret, arrive at the village
  of Deerbrook to stay with their cousin Mr Grey and his wife, speculation is rife
  that one of them might marry the local apothecary Edward Hope. Although he is immediately
  attracted to Margaret, Hope is ultimately persuaded to marry the beautiful Hester.
  The unhappiness of their marriage is compounded when a malicious village gossip
  accuses Hope of grave-robbing.
